      <h1 class="intro">Culture refers to the patterns of thought and behaviour of people. It includes values, beliefs, rules of conduct, and patterns of social, political and economic organisation. These are passed on from one generation to the next by formal as well as informal processes. Culture consists of the ways in which we think and act as members of a society. Thus, all the achievements of group life are collectively called culture. In popular parlance, the material aspects of culture, such as scientific and technological achievements are seen as distinct from culture which is left with the non-material, higher achievements of group life (art, music, literature, philosophy, religion and science). Culture is the product of such an organization and expresses itself through language and art, philosophy and religion. It also expresses itself through social habits, customs, economic organisations and political institutions.

      Indian culture is an invaluable possession of our society. Indian culture is the oldest of all the cultures of the world. Inspite of facing many ups and downs Indian culture is shinning with all it‘s glory and splendor. Culture is the soul of nation. On the basis of culture, we can experience the prosperity of its past and present.</h1>
